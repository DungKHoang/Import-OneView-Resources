#Enclosure Group  name,# LIG Name,"# An Enclosure Group can reference multiple Logical Interconnect Groups, once per Interconnect Bay.
# Syntax is:
#         LIG-object   -> 1 single LIG for all Interconnect Bay
#         Frame# = LIG-A,LIG-B | Frame## = LIG-C,LIG-D
# 
# Note: Use | as separator","# N/A if C7000
# Number of Synergy Frames that participate in an Enclosure Group","# N/A if C7000
# Use to specify how  IPv4 Addresses will be assigned to 
# Synergy resources management interface(s).
#  Allowed values:
#           External -  The IPv4 address is managed externally.
#           DHCP -  The IPv4 address is assigned using DHCP (Default).
#           AddressPool - The IPv4 address is assigned from a pool of IP addresses specified by the AddressPool parameter ","# N/A if C7000
# Name of the IPv4 Address Pool as listed in Get-HPOVSubnet","# N/A if C7000
# Specify the Synergy Image Stream deployment network type.
# Allowed values:
#         Internal - Deployment network is an internal, managed by the Frame links.
#         External - Deployment network is connected to an External management switch.
#        None - No deployment network will be configured (default)","# N/A if C7000
# The Ethernet Network with the purpose property set to Management
# Allowed values:
#         Internal - Deployment network is an internal, managed by the Frame links.
#         External - Deployment network is connected to an External management switch.
#        None - No deployment network will be configured (default)","# The Power Redundancy Mode to set when an Enclosure is added to the appliance.
# Allowed Values:
#    RedundantPowerFeed - Provides N+N Power Redundancy Configuration
